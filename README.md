Deep Learning with PyTorch
Deep Learning with PyTorch involves utilizing PyTorch, a Python-based scientific computing package, for neural network implementation. PyTorch serves as a replacement for NumPy, leveraging GPU power and accelerators, and offers an automatic differentiation library crucial for neural network development
> Here is an overview of how to use PyTorch for deep learning:

    - Define the Model: PyTorch provides pre-built neural network architectures like fully connected networks, CNNs, and RNNs through the torch.nn module.
    - Define the Loss Function: Evaluate the model's performance using loss functions like cross-entropy loss or mean squared error loss.
    - Define the Optimizer: Update the model's parameters based on the loss function gradients using optimizers like Adam or SGD.
    - Train the Model: Utilize PyTorch's data loading and processing library torch.utils.data to train the model on a dataset

* PyTorch offers a dynamic computational graph facilitating complex neural network modeling efficiently.
*  While PyTorch is widely used in deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision applications, it may have limitations in mobile and browser deployment compared to TensorFlow alternatives
